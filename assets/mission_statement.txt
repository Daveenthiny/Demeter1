3. AWS Solution Architecture for Demeter
3.1 Frontend Architecture (AWS Amplify)
The Demeter marketplace frontend will be built and hosted using AWS Amplify. Amplify Hosting offers a scalable, reliable platform for deploying static website files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). To accelerate development and ensure a consistent user experience, Amplify UI components will be used for common elements such as authentication forms, buttons, and navigation menus. AWS Amplify will streamline data interaction with the backend, allowing developers to work with local data models while synchronizing with cloud-based data in Amazon DynamoDB via AppSync. This setup also supports offline capabilities for users.
Location-based features, crucial for connecting users with nearby food and composters, will be implemented using AWS Amplify Geo. This service, powered by Amazon Location Service, provides APIs and components for integrating maps, location search, and geofencing. Customers can view available food items on a map, search for specific food types or vendors, and receive notifications when expiring food becomes available nearby.
3.2 Backend Architecture (AWS Amplify & AWS AppSync)
The backend leverages a serverless architecture driven by AWS Amplify. Amplify provisions a robust GraphQL API via AWS AppSync, serving as the primary interface for frontend interactions with data stored in Amazon DynamoDB. This API handles creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of data for food items, vendors, customers, composters, and orders.
3.3 User Authentication and Authorization (AWS Cognito)
Secure user authentication and authorization for customers, vendors, and composters is managed using Amazon Cognito. A Cognito User Pool serves as the central directory for managing user identities, handling sign-up, login, password recovery, and other flows. Distinct user groups (e.g., 'Customers,' 'Vendors,' 'Composters') are created to differentiate user roles. Role-based access control is implemented via Cognito groups and IAM roles, ensuring users have only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
3.4 Data Storage (AWS DynamoDB)
Amazon DynamoDB is the primary data store for Demeter, providing a highly scalable and flexible NoSQL database solution. The design includes several tables:
• FoodItems: Stores details about each food item, with keys for itemID and vendorID (as a global secondary index). Attributes include name, description, images, expiryDate, price, quantity, condition, location, and a flag for composter availability.
• Vendors: Stores vendor-specific information such as vendorID, name, contact information, location, and average rating.
• Customers: Uses customerID as the primary key and stores attributes like name, contact information, and location preferences.
• Composters: Uses composterID as the primary key, with attributes for name, contact information, location, capacity, and accepted food types.
• Orders: Uses orderID as the primary key (with customerID as a global secondary index) and stores order details including vendorID, orderDate, status, total amount, and items ordered.
• UserPreferences: Uses a composite key of userID and preferenceType to store various user-specific settings.
DynamoDB Streams can be enabled on relevant tables to trigger Lambda functions for real-time notifications and other event-driven processes.
3.5 Location Services (AWS Amplify Geo)
AWS Amplify Geo is key to providing location-based functionalities within Demeter. Maps integrated into the frontend allow users to visually explore available food items and composting services nearby. Amplify Geo simplifies the display of maps from providers like Esri or HERE. It also enables location search functionalities for customers and composters, using APIs such as Geo.searchByText() and Geo.searchByCoordinates().
Geofencing capabilities support a nearby expiring food alert system. Vendors specify the location of their food items, and customers set a preferred location and radius. When a food item nearing its expiry date is listed within a customer's geofence, an event triggers a Lambda function to send a notification. Similarly, composter locations are tracked to match them with vendors who have unsold food available for composting.
4. Conceptual Website Code Structure
4.1 HTML Structure
The HTML structure will use semantic HTML5 elements to ensure accessibility and SEO optimization. The homepage will feature a prominent section highlighting featured food items or vendors, with clear calls to action for each user type. A dedicated product listing page will display available food items with integrated search and filtering options. Each food item links to a detailed product page that includes comprehensive information, vendor details, and options for reservation or purchase. Separate registration and login pages will be provided for each user type, and dedicated dashboards will be available for managing listings, orders, payouts, and order history.
4.2 CSS Styling
The CSS styling for Demeter will draw inspiration from a clean, green color scheme. A consistent style guide will use a primary green paired with white backgrounds to create a fresh, trustworthy feel, with yellow accents strategically highlighting important elements such as calls to action and alerts. Responsive design principles, implemented via CSS media queries, will ensure the website adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices. Readability is prioritized with clear, appropriately sized fonts for headings and body text. UI elements like buttons, forms, and navigation menus will be styled to provide intuitive visual cues.
4.3 JavaScript Functionalities
JavaScript will drive the dynamic behavior of the Demeter website. AWS Amplify Auth will handle user authentication processes, including sign-up, login, and session management. API calls to the backend—using Amplify and AppSync—will fetch and display data on the frontend, such as populating product listings and updating dashboards. Dynamic search and filtering functionalities will update displayed results based on user input. User interactions with forms, like submitting orders or updating profiles, will be managed through asynchronous JavaScript calls. Additionally, integration of maps and location services via Amplify Geo will involve JavaScript libraries to display maps, handle user interactions, and perform location searches. Real-time updates and notifications (e.g., alerts for nearby expiring food) may use WebSockets or other real-time communication mechanisms provided by AWS AppSync.
5. Scalability and Performance
The Demeter marketplace is designed for scalability and high performance by leveraging AWS Lambda and Amazon DynamoDB. Lambda functions automatically scale based on request volume, and DynamoDB handles large amounts of data and traffic through automatic scaling. DynamoDB’s read/write capacity modes are optimized for cost and performance based on usage patterns.
6. Deployment and Maintenance
Deployment and maintenance are streamlined using AWS Amplify Console, which offers a fully managed CI/CD workflow that automatically builds and deploys frontend and backend updates when changes are pushed to the repository. Comprehensive monitoring and logging using AWS CloudWatch ensure the application’s health and performance are continuously tracked, allowing for proactive issue resolution. Regular software updates, security patching, and ongoing maintenance will ensure the platform’s long-term stability and reliability.
